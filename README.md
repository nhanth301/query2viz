# Streamlit LangChain Chatbot for SQL Data Exploration

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a **Streamlit chatbot** integrated with **LangChain** and **OpenAI GPT-4**, enabling natural language interaction with a SQL database. Users can ask questions in plain language, and the chatbot generates SQL queries, retrieves relevant data, and dynamically produces visualizations using Python libraries such as **Matplotlib** or **Plotly**.

No more manual filtering or complex SQL commandsâ€”just ask, and the bot provides intelligent, insightful, visual answers in seconds.

## System Architecture
The architecture of the Streamlit LangChain Chatbot consists of a SQL Agent for query generation, a Python Agent for visualization, and a Streamlit interface for interactive chat.
